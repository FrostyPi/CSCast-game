First game I made that wasn't a flappy bird clone. 

Felt like a genius when I increased the spread between each raycast line, and drew a transparent polygon surface over it, and applied a mask to said surface in order to detect objects via collision.



python version 3.10.9
pygame version 2.1.2
pytmx version 3.31

run game by running "python main.py" in this directory, without the quotation marks

also: I've used a distorted snippet of Mr. Brightside by The Killers. Hopefully this counts as a citation?
