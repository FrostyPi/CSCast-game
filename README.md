First game I made that wasn't a flappy bird clone. 

Felt like a genius when I increased the spread between each raycast line, and drew a transparent polygon surface over it, and applied a mask to said surface in order to detect objects via collision. PRobably not that impressive :(

Need to work on my art/sound skills with Aseprite/Audacity. Complete garbo
Game also needs UI/Instructions but I am not currently psyched

Overall very fun project to make, much more fun than actually playing the game.
